def play_t

#In this example, the `play_midi` function reads a MIDI file and plays each note using the piezo buzzer. 
#The `play_tone` function remains the same as in your original code.
#This approach allows for greater flexibility in your music creation, 
#as you can compose in a MIDI sequencer, convert to MIDI, and then play it through your Raspberry Pi buzzer setup. Keep in mind that the actual implementation may need some tuning, especially in timing and frequency conversion, to work seamlessly with your hardware setup.
